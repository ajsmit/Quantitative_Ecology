# Exploring the data

## In the beginning
At the start of the analysis, before we get to the hypothesis testing and multivariate approaches, we need to explore the data and compute the various synthetic descriptors (refer to the Basic Statistics Workshop). Recall that this exploratory data analysis includes the various measures of central tendency and dispersion/variation around the mean or median. Using the techniques that we already know, we can produce data summaries and statistical visualisations for each variable independently. So, we say that we produce univariate summaries, and if there is a need, we may also wish to include some of the univariate inferential statistics. Be guided by the research questions as to what is required. Typically, I don't like to produce too many detailed inferential statistics of the univariate data, choosing in stead to see which relationships and patterns emerge from the exploratory summary plots before testing their statistical significance using multivariate approaches. But that is me. Sometimes, some hypotheses call for a few univariate inferential analyses.

## Geographical coordinates

We will examine in this section ways to plot the species and environmental data on maps...

## Describe the environment

## Describe the community data

## Data transformations

Make a table of the various types of ecological distances (Euclidian, SÃ¸rensen, Bray-Curtis, etc.), and what to use them for (typically). Refer to Table 3.1, p. 51, of @borcard2011.
