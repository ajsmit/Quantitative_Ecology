    "# Topic 5: Species dissimilarities\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already covered all the necessary theory in Topic 3 - Biodiversity. The dissimilarity matrices that capture α-diversity and the contemporary measures of β-diversity are in fact *the same species dissmimilarity matrices I refer to in Topic 5*, and on which we will continue to rely on in the subsequent topics as input to many of the ordination techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, refer back to [Topic 3 - Biodiversity](https://github.com/ajsmit/Quantitative_Ecology/blob/main/jupyter_lab/05-beta_diversity.ipynb) and remind yourselves what that's all about.\n",
