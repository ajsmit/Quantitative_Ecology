# Cluster analysis

The objective of cluster analysis is to recognise groups of ecologically-related species in an environment, e.g., as which might belong to different vegetation types. Classification is suitable to studies where the processes in question do not necessarily act along gentle gradients, but result from rapid disjunctions between portions of the environment. Typical research questions that are addressed by classification techniques are:

* Are the collections of species similar enough to justify placing them into groups? 

* How do we recognise what the typical features are (e.g. the complement of species; the suite of environmental variables) that cause the samples to fall within one group or another?
